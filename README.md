xbmc-cbc-plugin
===============
Essentially, this is an xbmc plugin to listen to CBC radio stations online

# Installation

You can download the zipped plugin [here](https://github.com/superphunthyme/xbmc-cbc-plugin/archive/master.zip).

Installation should be like any other Kodi (XBMC) plugin.
 Navigate to 'Settings' → 'Add-ons → 'Install from zip file' -> Go to .zip location and select.
Check the [Kodi website](http://kodi.wiki/view/HOW-TO:Install_add-ons_from_zip_files) for an illustration.

# Testing
Tested as of version 15.2 of KODI.
The plugin works fine, however some stations have been removed.
They will be removed unless I can determine that they have simply moved.
